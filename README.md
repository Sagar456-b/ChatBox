## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project aims to create a networked distributed system using Java. The system will consist of a server and multiple clients, which will be able to communicate with each other over the network. The server will be responsible for managing the clients and their connections, while the clients will be able to send messages to each other through the server.



## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started with the project, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website.


### Installing

To install the project, you can clone the repository using Git:


```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/COMP1549-Networked_Distributed_System.git

```

### Running the Server

```
java Server

```
The server will start listening for client connections on the default port (see the code). You can change the port by editing the Server.java file.

### Running the Client


```
java Client


```
The client will prompt you for a username and then connect to the server. Once connected, you can send messages to other clients by typing them into the console



## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To use the system, you will need to start the server and multiple clients. Each client will need to enter a unique username. Once connected, clients can send messages to each other by typing them into the console. The server will relay the messages between clients.
